Decription:
This is a simple yet smart weather application I built that shows real-time weather updates and a 5-day forecast for any city in the world. The goal was to make it clean, modern, and easy to use. You just enter a city name or tap the “Current Location” button, and it instantly gives you the weather details for that place.

The app shows the current temperature, weather condition (like cloudy, sunny, rainy), and also the date and time, so you know exactly what the weather is like right now. There’s also a section that shows a 5-day forecast, with weather icons and temperatures for each day. It gives a clear picture of what the week ahead looks like.

One thing I’m proud of is the “Today’s Highlights” section — it displays extra info like humidity, wind speed, air pressure, visibility, and even sunrise and sunset times. It makes the app feel more complete and useful.

I also added country flags next to the city name, which gives it a more personal, global touch. The design is inspired by modern weather dashboards, with a dark theme, orange buttons, and soft cards that work well on both desktop and mobile devices.

Technically, the app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data. I used icons from Font Awesome and Boxicons, and the country flags are pulled dynamically using the country code.

This project helped me learn how to work with real APIs, manage JSON data, and improve UI/UX with responsive design. Overall, it’s a clean, minimal weather app that looks good and works well — and I’m excited to keep adding more features in the future!
